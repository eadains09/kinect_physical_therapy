# Kinect Physical Therapy

<t> Our project uses a Microsoft Kinect to track the patientâ€™s movements and give feedback as to how well they are doing the exercises. On screen, the patient will be able to see a model of how the movement should be done, which they can imitate, as well as the image the Kinect is seeing of their movements. The program will be able to give live feedback to the user about what they are doing right or wrong in their movements. This is intended to solve problems like the patient forgetting, or incorrectly doing, aspects of their exercises. Although it is likely not in the scope of this project, the goal is that future teams will expand on the backbone our project builds, making physical therapy more fun through gamification by adding fancier GUIs and a game-based structure that guides the users through their movements and their success or failure in the game is at least partially a result of their accuracy in their movements.

<t>The intended users of our project are any patients whose insurance does not cover physical therapy, or those who cannot afford to pay for physical therapy on their own. It could also be used to supplement an existing physical therapy recovery plan. We hope that using our program will provide these patients with the benefits of physical therapy at a lower cost, namely reduced pain and greater mobility.
